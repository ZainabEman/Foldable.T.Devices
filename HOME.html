					<h3> INTRODUCTION</h3>
					<p>A foldable smartphone (also known as a foldable phone or simply foldable) is a smartphone with a folding form factor.Actually, foldable devices are those devices that divide the screen into two portions.</p>
					<h3> First ever Foldable device</h3>
					<p>The first ever foldable device was introduced in 2018 by Royole FlexPai. Not exactly a well-known one, but Ultimately, later that year, Motorola and TCL also came up with their own foldable smartphones and successors to many foldable devices have already appeared, with the provisional highlight so far being the Oppo Find NO</p>

					<h3> How does it work?</h3>
					<p>The screens used for making foldable devices are known as OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode), and are made up of organic compounds, when electricity is passed through them they emit their own light, which means these screens do not require backlit lights for working, making screens more thin and flexible and also they generate more accurate colors and have a large color gamut, unlike LCD’s which require a back-lit light source for working due to which LCD’s become heavy and thick.<br>LED displays are actually printed on a thin layer of plastic, which allows them to bend and fold in many different ways..</p>

					<h3>Foldable laptops</h3>
					<p> The Asus Zenbook Fold is a true transformer of a PC.
						It's equal parts tablet, laptop and desktop, and unlike
						many other hybrid products, it's pretty good at all three.
						The key is a big 17-inch foldable display, even if that technology 
						is still in its early days.
